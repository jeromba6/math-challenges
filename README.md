# math-challenges
Some challenges to solve with a script. I did solve it with python but feel free to do it in your favorite programming langage or make your own version. Like zo see what you come up with.

## Challenge 01
For every number between 10000 and 100000 it can be create by the sum of 4 numbers to thes power of 2.
i.e.: 50074 = 223^2 + 16^2 + 8^2 + 5^2
The challenge is to find for all numbers the solution in as least steps an as fast as posible

## Challenge 02
Someone has a weight of 40 KG. At some point the weight falls and breaks in 4 pieces. With those 4 pieces each mass can be weight form 1 to 40 KG as long as it are whole numbers.
The challenge is to calculate what the weight of the 4 pieces is.
Bonus 1 - make your program so it outputs which pieces to use for every weight
Bonus 2 - make your program so it's flexible and you can us it also for 121 KG which breaks in to 5 pieces or 13 KG which breaks into 3 pieces
